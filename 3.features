Features
--------

* **Hidden files**: Blogstrap will return a 404 if requesting an
  article with a filename starting with `.`. This should allow you to
  commit dot configuration files like `.git` or `.gitconfig`. without
  fearing them getting accessed. It also ensures that nothing in the
  blogstrap configuration directory (`.blogstrap`) is going to be
  served.

* **Page Variables**: Blogstrap presents page variables that can be
  inserted in your articles. At the time of this writing only `{{ toc
  }}` is available and gets replaced by a Table of Contents

* **Overshadow**: Makes it possible to serve different content for
  markdown and html. If a file exists with the same name and
  `.html`/`.md` suffix, it will be served in priority when requested.

* **Static Pages**: The optional configuration variable
  **STATIC_PAGES** takes a list of pages as values, and allows the
  creation of links to the pages that are present on the navbar at
  every page.

* **TOC blacklist**: The optional configuration variable
  **TOC_BLACKLIST** allows to explicitly remove some pages from the
  `toc` variable.

**Overshadow Examples**:

```
.
├── article
└── article.html
```

If `text/html` is requested then `article.html` will be served.
`article` will be served in any other case.

```
.
├── article
└── article.md
```

In this case, if `text/html` is requested then `article` will be
served. `article.md` will be served in any other case.

```
.
├── article
├── article.html
└── article.md
```

In this case, `article` will never be served.
