Blogstrap - A simple blogging tool
==================================

![](images/logo.png)

Blogstrap is a simple blogging tool that puts emphasis on the
following 3 concepts:


**Readability of the source code**

A Blogstrap blog is just a directory that contains articles. It should
be readable using common text reading tools, and easily browsable in a
terminal the way that any directory of files can. Blogstrap avoids
complicated directory structures, databases and any other construct
that sacrifices readability of the source.


**Minimalism of features**

Blogstrap doesn't provide the traditional blogging features, like
posting an article or managing user permissions. Instead it expects
the user to manage the files on disk directly and push them to the
server using their favorite tools. It is recommended, but not
required, to use version control systems which provide features like
draft publishing (access control), article review, or history. I use
git and it's worked well for me. So far.


**HTML belongs in the browser only**

HTML is a format that belongs only inside the browser. There's no reason to
generate, store or serve HTML outside it. Unless specifically requested,
Blogstrap will generally serve raw markdown content. However if the client
requests HTML (with the `Accept: text/html` header, all popular browsers use
this by default), Blogstrap will serve a Javascript library along the markdown
content so that the html conversion is done on the client side.


How does it work?
-----------------

Blogstrap is a [Flask](https://flask.pocoo.org/) application that
serves static files over the web. The files are expected to be written
in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). If
the client requests html explicitly, Blogstrap wraps the file in HTML
tags, along with some javascript based on
[Showdown.js](https://showdownjs.com/) to handle client-side
conversion of the text into HTML, as well as some frontend artefacts
based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) to make the page
beautitful.
