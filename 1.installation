Installation
------------

* Available on PyPI:

```
$ pip install blogstrap
```

* It's still changing fast so I recommend installing from source:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/joehakimrahme/Blogstrap
$ cd Blogstrap
$ python setup.py install
```

It's recommended that you install Blogstrap inside a virtualenv or in a
dedicated virtual machine (or cloud instance).
